- MVC (Model View Controller) => model is the data part, controller is the brain part and view is the template part.
- Templates provides a view for browser even when there's no frontend code.
- Only with Node, we can make 'fullstack' projects using templates like EJS or JADE.
- EJS has very few rules.
